1,"This is a monthly price index published quarterly. Quarterly indexes as published in The Daily are available in table 18-10-0252 (formerly CANSIM 332-0025)."
2,"North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 44112 has not been surveyed, and therefore data are not available at this time."
3,"Data-quality indicators are based on measures of survey precision (standard errors of the estimated figures), estimates of market coverage (based on the RSPI sample), and the number of reported price quotes. Quality indicators: Code D = Acceptable (market coverage equal to or greater than 25%, and standard error greater than 2%, but less than or equal to 5%). Code E = Use with caution (market coverage less than 25% or standard error greater than 5% or fewer than five reported price quotes). Index series without data-quality indicators are considered to be statistically reliable."
4,"For data based on the 2008=100 index, refer to table 18-10-0035 (formerly CANSIM 332-0003), which has been archived."
